1. The pivot is used as a comparison to divide the list
in two parts, the numbers less than the pivot and the
ones that are greater as well. At the end the pivot
becomes the number you're looking for.

The pivot doesn't have to be necesarily have to be an assigned
number. In fact there are scientific papers that say that
choosing the pivot in a random place actually makes the program
more efficient, because it makes it imposible to hit its worst
case even when the list is ordered. As long as the pivot is
within the range of 0 and the len of the list -1.

No, it will still behave the same, and probably smoother.

2. Test cases should be:
For repeated numbers [1, 4, 4, 4, 6, 1, 3] k = 2
            Results: 4
For Big numbers [100, 300, 200, 150] k = 4
            Results: 300
For ordered ascending list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] k = 7
            Results: 8
For unordered list [10, 7, 6, 2, 1] k = 1
            Results: 2
For number outside the range [1, 2, 3, 4] k = 5
            Result: []

3. For simple median, a bigger file is going to be slower,
but for a median with quick select.
   Simple Median:
    0.45194003768522156
    0.47363803151423917
    0.44763435343078106
   Select Median:
    0.1156397316158733
    0.11296850800583039
    0.11612693362857192
