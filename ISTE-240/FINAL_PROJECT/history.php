            <p>Panama’s history can be separated into three main periods. The first one was when Panama was colonized by Spain Conquistadores. The second one when we join with Colombia and the present which is our current society after the dictatorship from general Noriega.</p>

        <div class="section-paragraph">
            <p>Panama was discovered in 1501 by the Spaniards who were looking for another route for India. When they first got to Panama they called Native Americans “Indios” because they thought they were in India. However, Panama wasn’t colonized until 1519 when Spaniard Pedrarias Dávila founded “Nuestra Señora de la Asunción de Panamá” known in Panama as “Panama viejo”. This city would later in 1671 be destroyed by Pirate Henry Morgan and would force to rebuild the city towards the west.</p>
            <p>After years of unhappiness in the isthmus, panama was able to achieve a bloodless revolution and achieve their Independence the 28 of November 1821. Panamanians used the revolts that were happening in other spanish colonies to strike and join forces with “La Gran Colombia”.</p>

        <h1 class="section-title">Colombian Period</h1>
        <div class="section-paragraph">
            <p>After the Panama Independence, Panama joined “La Gran Colombia” which included Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador. Throughout the years Panama and Colombia had political problems, because Colombia was considered the central state therefore they had complete control over Panama. However, Panama was not in Colombia’s best interests. So when the French failed building the Canal and the United States offered to continue and finish it Colombia refused. This event made Panamanians extremely angry and wanted a separation.</p>
            <p>Colombia refusing to allow the United States to finish the Canal sparked “La guerra de los mil días” which lasted for 3 years and had around 120,000 casualties. This war was heavily founded and encouraged by The United States because they wanted to build the Canal. A few months after the war ended on November 3rd 1903 we officially separated from Colombia and became an independent nation.</p>

        <h1 class="section-title">Present Days</h1>
        <div class="section-paragraph">
            <p>Panama’s first move as an independent Nation was to allow The United States to finish the construction of the Canal. However, The United States of course did not build it for free, but took control of the entire Canal Zone basically creating a United States inside Panama and most Panamanians were not happy with this. After several protests and deadly incidents were Panamanian’s high-school students the center of, President Carter and Panama’s current President Omar Torrijos came together to sign Torrijos-Carter Treaty which said that the Canal and the Canal area was to be returned to Panama by 12:00 December 31st 1999.</p>
            <p>Omar Torrijos was eventually killed by what’s thought to be his successor Manuel Antonio Noriega in a plane accident. Noriega eventually took control of Panama and ran it’s government as a dictatorship which most Panamanians were against. However, The United States started worrying about the status of the Canal under General Noriega’s dictatorships and decided to invade Panama to capture General Noriega. After the capture of General Noriega, Panama became a democratic government just how it is today.</p>
