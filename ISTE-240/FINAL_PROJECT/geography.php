                <p>Panama is located in Central America, bordered by the Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean, Costa Rica and Colombia. Panama’s location has been praised a lot because of how good it is, thanks to our location, we are able to have the Panama Canal and very few to almost no natural disasters. Panama has a total area of 78,200 square kilometers. Panama’s terrain consists of steep mountains, large plains, rugged mountains.</p>
                <p>Panama’s weather is very warm and humid, it averages around 82 degrees fahrenheit and 80 percent humidity making it unpleasant to some people. We have a lot of different beaches, “Playa Venao” known for being one of the best beaches for surfing. Our highest point is “Volcan Baru” which is currently an inactive volcano that can be climbed today. Panama also has a lot of islands, most of which are tourist attractions.</p>
