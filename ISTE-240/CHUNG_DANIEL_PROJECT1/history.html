            <p>Panama’s history can be separated into three main periods. The first one was when Panama was 
                colonized by Spain Conquistadores. The second one when we join with Colombia and the present 
                which is our current society after the dictatorship from general Noriega.

            <h1>Spanish Colonial Period</h1>
            <p class="sub-description">Panama was discovered in 1501 by the Spaniards who were looking for 
                another route for India. When they first got to Panama they called Native Americans “Indios” 
                because they thought they were in India. However, Panama wasn’t colonized until 1519 when 
                Spaniard Pedrarias Dávila founded “Nuestra Señora de la Asunción de Panamá” known in Panama 
                as “Panama viejo”. This city would later in 1671 be destroyed by Pirate Henry Morgan and would 
                force to rebuild the city towards the west. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="sub-description">After years of unhappiness in the isthmus, panama was able to achieve 
                a bloodless revolution and achieve their Independence the 28 of November 1821. Panamanians used 
                the revolts that were happening in other spanish colonies to strike and join forces with 
                “La Gran Colombia”.</p>

            <h1>Colombian Period</h1>
            <p class="sub-description">After the Panama Independence, Panama joined “La Gran Colombia” which 
                included Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador. Throughout the years Panama and Colombia had political 
                problems, because Colombia was considered the central state therefore they had complete control
                 over Panama. However, Panama was not in Colombia’s best interests. So when the French failed 
                 building the Canal and the United States offered to continue and finish it Colombia refused. 
                 This event made Panamanians extremely angry and wanted a separation.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="sub-description">Colombia refusing to allow the United States to finish the Canal sparked 
                “La guerra de los mil días” which lasted for 3 years and had around 120,000 casualties. This war 
                was heavily founded and encouraged by The United States because they wanted to build the Canal.
                 A few months after the war ended on November 3rd 1903 we officially separated from Colombia and 
                 became an independent nation.

            <h1>Present Days</h1>
            <p class="sub-description">Panama’s first move as an independent Nation was to allow The United States
                 to finish the construction of the Canal. However, The United States of course did not build it 
                 for free, but took control of the entire Canal Zone basically creating a United States inside 
                 Panama and most Panamanians were not happy with this. After several protests and deadly incidents
                  were Panamanian’s high-school students the center of, President Carter and Panama’s current President 
                  Omar Torrijos came together to sign Torrijos-Carter Treaty which said that the Canal and the Canal 
                  area was to be returned to Panama by 12:00 December 31st 1999. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="sub-description">Omar Torrijos was eventually killed by what’s thought to be his successor 
                Manuel Antonio Noriega in a plane accident. Noriega eventually took control of Panama and ran it’s 
                government as a dictatorship which most Panamanians were against. However, The United States started
                 worrying about the status of the Canal under General Noriega’s dictatorships and decided to invade 
                 Panama to capture General Noriega. After the capture of General Noriega, Panama became a democratic 
                 government just how it is today.
