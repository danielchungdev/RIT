            <p>Panamanian culture is a mix of cultures all over the world. Panama has mixed from Native, Europeans thanks to 
                the Spanish Conquistadors, Asian, American and African because of the Panama’s Canal project. 
                Panama values culture a lot and this is seen throughout the many festivals that are held throughout 
                the year.
