            <h1>Panama Viejo</h1>
            <p class="sub-description">This monument is the oldest building in the whole city because it was 
                the original city before it was destroyed by pirate Henry Morgan. This is a very big tourist 
                attraction because of how well the structure has been maintained since the 1500's. This place
                is great for those who love to learn about history.

            <h1>Ave. Balboa</h1>
            <p class="sub-description">For most people an Avenue is not really a tourstist place. However, in 
                Ave. Balboa Panama gets the best sunlight for picture and often the sky becomes pinkish and 
                allows you to see the magnificent skyline. This is a great spot for people to take pictures.

            <h1>Casco Viejo</h1>
            <p class="sub-description">Casco Viejo at night it's the most lively place in the city. This old-style
                looking street is home to Panama's night life. The best restaurants and bars are in the area. It's 
                a great place to see how houses and buildings were built in the older days, tipically a location 
                people with architecture interests go to.

            <h1>Chiriqui</h1>
            <p class="sub-description">8 hours away from the city lies Chiriqui. Chiriqui is a completly different 
                feel from the city. It gives you the feel of nature that the city doesn't give you. This is a 
                good toursit palce because there is so much to do. From hiking "Volcan Baru" all the way to 
                zip-line. Chiriqui is also home to the most expensive coffee in the world "Panama Geisha". This is 
                a must go place for those coffee lovers.
