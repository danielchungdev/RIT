8. Given the program files main.c, circle.h and circle.c:

    a.) What commands will compile the source files into object files?
        
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

	-c
        
    b.) What command will link the object files
        into an executable named broken?
        
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	
	gcc -o broken circle.o main.o	

		
        
    c.) Why does the program compile but fail to link?
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

	the program would compile but fail to link because of a undefined referece to 
	"getArea" because in the file circle.c the function of getArea was written 
	incorrectly as "getAreas".
