1. When you first log in, what is the absolute path of your home directory?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

	/home/stu13/s4/dec8768

2. What command will list the contents of your current
working directory, so that it shows the difference between
files and directories without descending into any directories?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	
	ls -a

3. What command would you use to change your working directory from
your home directory to the existing subdirectory Courses/?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

	cd [Directory name]

4. Within the Courses/ subdirectory, what command would you use to
create the subdirectory csci243/?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	
	mkdir [Directory name]

5. When warning.c is compiled as: 
        gcc -o warning warning.c
    There is no indication of any warnings/problems, but there are issues.
    
    a.) What compiler flags are used to enable the display of warnings?
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	-Wall
	-Wextra 
	-pedantic 
	-std=c99

	:  2 points
    
    b.) In your own words, explain all warnings from compiling warning.c
	with the recommended compilation options.
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

	In the function compute there is a variable that is not being used. While this won't stop the program from
	compiling, it wastes memory space which is why is sugested to deleted. 

	In the main functions there is an array of size 0. While this wont stop the program from compiling it is 
	taking up memory space that can be used for something else. 

	The main functions takes a (int argc) which is unused and therefor taking up unnecesary space in memory.

	In the function compute, it is declared as (int compute) and it is not returning anything. It is expecting a
	return type of type int.
	
	In main there is a uninintialized variable. It is declared but it has not been given any value.

    c.) Fix warning.c so it compiles without warning and runs correctly to
	produce the output specified in the code documentation.

	(Your answer is the submitted code.)

    d.) There is a 'super-picky' warning flag; what is it and what problem
