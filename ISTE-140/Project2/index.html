		<h2>The Internet</h2>
		<img class="first" src="http://serenity.ist.rit.edu/~dec8768/140/project2/assets/media/G69Dec.jpg" alt="ARPANET">
			<p>
			The internet itself is a massive network of networks, that connects
			millions of computers globally, making it possible for computers to 
			communicate with each other as long as they are connected to the internet.
			The idea of the internet was created from the idea of interconnected 
			machines,  was proposed by J.C.R. Licklider in 1962. The ARPANET was created
			by a computer scientist called Larry Roberts, he with DARPA, built the ARPANET
			on 56,000 bits per second telephone lines. In 1969 the first message sent via 
			the ARPANET from the research lab in UCLA to the lab in Stanford. 
			</p>
			<p> 
			While all of these happened, in 1971 Ray Tomlinson was working on a 
			mail system which eventually became the email, and computer scientist
			Vinton Cerf, invented the TCP, allowing to computers connect to each
			other which later became IP. With the invention of TCP, came the creation
			of telnet. Telnet is a protocol used to stablish a terminal communication
			from one computer to another one. The main problem with telnet is that it's
			not encoded, therefor shortly after it was replaced by the SSH. SSH allows a 
			user to remotetly connect to other computers over a secure network. By the 
			end of the 1971, more computers were added to the ARPANET.

		<h2>The World Wide Web</h2>
			<p>
			The world wide web is a way of accessing information over the internet.
			It's model that allows you to share information via the Internet. At the
			start of the web, there was an applicaction called gopher that would 
			organize text files so that they could be sent from servers across the 
			world. Eventually this was replaced by HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol),
			which is the protocol to transfer hypertext data.
			</p>
			<p>
			The world wide web began with Tim Bernes-Lee, which transformed the internet
			from a scientific data sharing place for scientists to a network in which
			anyone with an internet access was able to use.
			</p>
			<p>
			With the invention of the world wide web several browsers were created, 
			between those we can find MOSAIC, NETSCAPE, and Lynx. MOSAIC which is well 
			known for popularizing the web. MOSAIC is a hypertext tool inspiried most 
			web browsers to come, specilly "NETSCAPE" which was a  navigator which was 
			used by 90% of the web users. Lynx is a text based browser that up to today
			it still up and running making it the oldest browser.
			</p> 
		<h2>Difference between "The World Wide Web" and "The Internet"</h2>
			<p>
			The main thing people confuse is the internet with the world wide web. The
			web really is just one of the ways that information can be transmited over
			the internet. The internet can also be used for email, but relies on SMTP,
			Usenet, instant messaging and FTP. FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol 
			that is used to transfer files between computer on a network.
