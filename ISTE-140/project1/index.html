	<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
	<p>My name is Daniel Chung I'm from Panama City, Panama and I have Chinese heritage, making me both Latino and
    Asian! I'm currently a student at Rochester Institute of Technology, in their program of Computer Exploration.
    I've always enjoyed playing around with computers and eventually I learned some basic programming. I also have a big love for music
    I love to play the guitar and the bass.</p>
    <p>My biggest passions are volunteering and photography. I took an interest in volunteering and photography when I was
    around 15 which was my first volunteering experience. Back in the city we don't really see or experience the poor side of Panama
    so we grow completely oblivious of the fact it exists, so I wanted to show people the things I saw during my volunteering 
    work to hopefully do some change in society. Up to now, I've been an active member of the organization <a id="techo" href="http://www.techo.org/">TECHO</a>
	for 3 years.
	</p>
	<h3>MY PURPOSE</h3>
	<p>The purpose of this site is to show the skills that I've learned so far during our web and mobile class, and also so you can learn 
	a little bit more about me.</p>
