		<h4>About me</h4>
		<p>My name is Daniel Chung, I was born in Panama January 23, 1999. I am Chinese, but 
		I have more latino culture than Chinese culture in me. I enjoy doing a lot of 
		volunteer work and playing video games.</p>
		
		<p>The main reason why I took this course is because I know that web pages will never
		die, and it's important to know how to make them because that's what the user will
		see when you try to advertise/sell your your product. I hope my career will be a 
		software engineer because I would like to create software with a more user 
		friendly environment.</p>
